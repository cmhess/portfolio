      <h2> Early History</h2>
      <p> I was born in Niles, Michigan in 1975 and remained there through my high school years before migrating to Florida to attend the state's flagship university in 1993. After four years as a Florida Gator, I moved to Seattle, Washington and began my Ph.D working on the evolutionary genetics of disease resistance in house finches. From there I taught courses in the Seattle area for a year and then moved to Portland, OR for a year as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Portland. In 2007, I accepted a job as an Assistant Professor at Butler University in Indianapolis. However after years of battling the dual academic challenges, my wife is a Comparative Endocrinologist, I left academia to take a job in academic publishing.</p>  
      <h2> <a href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com">Pearson Education </a></h2>
      <p> I started my publishing career as the National Trainer for Online Homework in the Sciences. This was fun for a while and my wife was able to get a job she was much happier with at Radford University in Southwestern Virginia. That said, I spent much of my time helping people "MacGuyver" their courses, weighting grades, dropping the lowest score, setting up their preferred grading scheme. I did not have to think much about science. Around three years ago I was offered a position as an acquisitions editor, really more like an executive producer, for Pearson's Chemistry list and jumped at the chance. I now help run a 90 million dolar a year list including making decisions on what we do with both print and digital. It is a challenging, but also exciting time in publishing and one where it seems knowledge of how to build wed-based interactives is absolutely critical.</p>
