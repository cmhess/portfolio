            <p>I recently was named one of Pearson's Brand Advocates after a call went out to the masses of the company; and like a good soldier I posted this news to my LinkedIn account when it was suggested that I do so. This resulted in quite a few "what the heck?" and "brand advocate ?@*!" texts, IMs and the like. You see, a good portion of my community is still part of academia, a leftover of my previous career as a biology professor. To them, being an editor is one thing, but their message was clear, even before episode 7 debuted, I had been seduced by the dark side. There was certainly a time in my life that these insinuations would have put me on the defensive, but those days are long past. Much of that has to do with the other committed Pearson professionals that I work with every day virtually and on campus. There are many ways to impact learning and while my impact on the 75 or so students I taught at Butler University back in the day was sometimes quite profound, my overall footprint on education has grown exponentially since joining Pearson ( for instance, over 450,000 students used MasteringChemistry last year!) I know that many of you in sales or marketing or the likes could make a lot more money in other areas, but you believe in education. You believe in what we are all trying to do to help people improve themselves. Your impact is also profound.</p>
 
            <p>That said, I applied for the brand advocate program because I think we can do a better job of getting that message out and I thought I might learn something more about how the company works outside of my editorial silo. This impetus for expanding my horizons actually started a while back when my manager Jeanne Zalesky suggested that I seek out something that would make me a better editor. In my slightly OCD way, I signed up for a Web Development Certificate Program at my grad school alma mater (they had to look up my old student ID to get me registered, it has been a while!) I have no designs on launching a third career building websites, but I find that more and more I am involved in product development of interactives where I have little to no understanding of the architecture that underlies them. So now I spend 9-midnight every Thursday taking a course learning how to build the types of products I oversee. Again, I am not going to jump ship to do this full time, but one night a while back when I took an object and made it expand and contract, adding in a delay and a couple of other neat tricks while my eyes were glazing over at the end of my class, I really felt good about my expanded skill set and how it would help me understand feasibility and timelines for creating things we need to be working toward. The idea of Pearson's "Always Learning" works internally as well.</p>
 
<p>Five years ago if you had asked me what I thought I would be doing, the answer would have been wearing a tweed jacket in the front of a classroom trying to get students to wrap their heads around the relative importance of natural selection versus genetic drift or some other awesome thing about biology. If you had told me I was going to be learning to build web-based interactives, captaining the ship on chemistry books that were first published before I was born as well as exciting new "books" that will live only in the cloud, I likely would have suggested an intervention for whatever illegal chemicals you were clearly currently taking. But some crazy people (Beth Wilbur, Brian Buckley, I am looking at you) convinced me that Pearson was a place where one could make a difference and now you are stuck with me, and my tweed. I don't regret my decision and hope they still feel like their faith in me was justified.</p>
 
<p>Part of being a brand advocate is to toss out a blog or two every so often. I will try to keep it focused on the things that I know best (pedagogy, using educational technology, student engagement) but I welcome suggestions if you have any. I certainly expect to learn something from doing this and there is certainly nothing wrong with expanding that footprint a little further!</p>
